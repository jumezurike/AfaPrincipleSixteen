AFA Oracle: Introduction to the Principle of Sixteen (Ikpukpara)
Important points you should make sure you don't miss out on from this post in your quest to unravel the enigma of the principle of sixteen. This is one of the earliest human artificial intelligence confered to certain group of people in the ancient times. The knowledge as a thriving technology follows rituals assembled as deep learning, machine learning, and implementation requiring a high language untilizaton which is unfamiliar to the locales although it might sound like the local languages. 

## Who is an AFA Oracle?
An AFA oracle is one who is initiated (a human representation) in the system of AFA which respects the duality of nature and ability to know beyond human capabilities. This one has acquired certain skills by understanding the language of AFA and noting easily, its various combinations as a way to predict accurately. The high level language is not for the novice (Ofeke) to understand. It could be taught to the "Ofeke" who might not be quite aligned. Through informamtion and belief it could become a benefit. 

## What is the AFA Oracle?
The Oracle is a problem solver when it comes to decision making. It is a blackbox like turing machine that can process many instructions and give a single output as the decision or conclusion. What is very interesting about it is that is uses a neural network represented as 4 x 4 matrix in which each cell holds a value accessed using the indices from 0-15. The matrix contains combination of words which in turn are expanded into spoken and written words. 

This could be mathematically or visually expanded into perfect squares: In the past initiator will announce the output or the result compiled by the oracle itself. This requires more than certain skills to understanding the language of AFA: Noting its various combinations with ease to predict things so subtle that the senses cannot perceive as a way of easily resolving human problems rife with logic tha emotional intelligence. 

## History of the principle of sixteen? 
The history of Ikpukpara cannot be easily placed in space-time. The practice was used from time immemorial especially in the very bloom of human development to answer the question of sickness, to compile herbs for medicinal purposes, to unveil secrets, to interpret dreams, and to recall genealogy. This practice was predominant in the middle-belt, south west, and south east of the modern day Nigeria. The Igbo were noted to use the four (4) strings and four (4) nodes per string computation. The Yoruba cousins used the two (2) strings and four (4) nodes per string computation.

According to history as it is recorded in Igbo land, a tribe in the eastern part of Nigeria, the ancient components of the AFA ensemble held by the Dibia AFA or doctor of AFA is instrumental. The people rely on the dibia AFA for an issue that has to do with the following:

- Reincarnation information 

- Seeking to know what the future holds and how to avoid potential dangers

- To find out why one is in a particular unfavorable condition for long

- To seek relationship advice and to find out if your partner is the right person for you to settle down with

- To know the cause and solution to a chronic disease or illness

Historically, Ikpukpara was basically used by Dibia AFA to help people in knowing what they cannot see with their physical eyes. It was use to bring peace, strengthen the broken once with clarity, and lead those lost in their path. 

Furthermore, Ikpukpara is based on the principles of the sixteen in a configuration of mkpuru AFA (AFA seeds). They are the main aspect of ancient existence as they enter many aspects of our lives by interpretation of these special numbers.

It is ordered in a set where the numerals are measures of count and quantity which start from zero, and one, two, four and progresses to the multiple of fours which is 16.

It is believed that 16 marks the bloom of human development which is why the number is specifically embedded in the traditional sense of science and technology.

In this sense of traditional science, there are 16 seeds or elements (nkpuru Afa) on a continuous based on basis of the 16 principles. The basis is designed for values to be accessed with the indices embedded in the Afa seed lexicography. 

According to what serves as the fundamental component of these numbers, four market days make a week. There are 13 months in the  Igbo calendar making all 364 days in a year. In Igbo culture, three heads are better than one, and no two heads are better than one. This is true because, in the culture, it is believed that a three-legged cooker will set the foundation for cooking.

It is imperative that we in the age of quantum computers must try to find the inflection point where the ancient crosses the path with the modern. 


## What are the Fundamentals of the Principle of sixteen?

The fundamentals are the 16 different seeds(with bool open or close; truth or false) borne within a 4 by 4 matrix. This brings about a truth table of over 256 for each string of 4 nodes. This means as the cast layer is increased so will the performance and accuracy in predictions. The components (text or characters) of written and spoken words forms permutation and combination of words which must be expanded for intelligence and benefit of others. This is a phenomemal similar in effect to modern AI practices. 

Is Ikpukpara a science, divinity, or culture?
It is all the three mentioned and every other thing in between. It is the way leading to the depth of understanding the world we live in. In ancient times AFA oracle, the machine or blackbox is what supercomputers or quantum computers represent to the modern world. The ability to glean intelligence from consciousness that are far removed from the cultre and prevailing reality sets it apart. Today, we rely on computers AI capabilities for anything we want to analyse for insight and some predictions. 

- SCIENCE

- DIVINITY

- CULTURE

- Economics

- Business

- Technology

Divinity (religion), philosophy, theology, science are found under one's culture. When a culture is deified it becomes a religion.The principle of sixteen has a cosmological traits to it. It permeates all aspects of our lives just like the computer. There is a parallel question which I believe will very well answer all this. 
Is the computing as we know it today a science, divinity or culture? We are open to futher investigation and justification of AFA: A practice which not many are savvy to the logic of its process. 

## What is the purpose of the principle of sixteen, and why is it a sacred practice?

Its purpose is to bring balance in human existence. Initially, Ikpukpara is a practice that incorporates connections between the unknown and known within a material medium by exptrapolating the esoteric to the world of being and existentiality. -The end goal is to use the supernatural intelligence, accuracy and performance to predict. It triggers the necessity to transfer this technique into the digital age, where equivalent solutions can be obtained via a computerised channel It fills the gap between problems humans can solve and those they might never solve in one' life time or life times. 

## How does the principle of sixteen fit into computer science and technology?
Mathematics is in the core of science and technology as well as Afa principles. The basis of AFA in the most rudimentary way forms a number system. The 0x(HEX) and 00 (BIN) are used in computers for communicating machine language as the computer interacts with humans. AFA strives for balance out of non-deterministic, deterministic, chaotic and some ordered planes. The principle's accuracy and performance promises easier ways for searching, prompting, combining and permuting words to predicting things in ways that we have never seen before.

## What is the relationship between the principle of Sixteen, machine learning and artificial intelligence? 

The principle of sixteen clearly establishes that all that you speak of, all you will speak of and all you have spoken of are embedded in the spectrum of all in existence. -It exists wherever energy traverses.

Machines mimic human intelligence to perform specific tasks. - Artificial intelligence.

The AFA seeds, although, initially trained without modern high level languages: They are highly coded to perform tasks that will take humans a very long time to establish: This is simply machine learning the combination of these words are always different bringing meaning so perculiar at each cast. 

Machines automatically learn from data or information without further programming (coding). From the accuracy and performance you can now predict to take action. One data set could be used to train many other machines. 

AFA, principle of sixteen provides the neural network that connects all other points in the performance, accuracy and predictions (activation). The more the sampling the better the predicted outcomes. 
       
When you look at the mNIST list you can see the modern ML was able to accurately identify the input from the list. AFA is to words what modern ML is to mNIST today. AFA system does more than just identifying hand-written characters

## Can we modularize this system so that patterns of divination systems from other parts of the globe would be codified?

Yes we can! Especially when we view the whole process before prediction as another ML model which constitutes training complexes over the years to address human problems. The machines where first trained by humans, later by machines and senses unknown to man. Automatic training is involved here as in anything ML. In simple terms other methods could be engaged as a subset of artificial  intelligence. - I would rather say that AI is the application of ML.

"Computer science mimics Afa Oracle - THE PRINCIPLES OF SIXTEEN.
# The principle of 16 
‘Ikpukpara’ is the principle of 16. Numerals here are measures of count and quantity which start from zero, one, two, four and progresses to the multiple of fours. At the very bloom of human development it was capped at 16.-This is basically two words form bits perspective. There are 16 seeds or elements (nkpuru Afa) in a continuous matrix held in the basis of the 16 principles. The basis is designed for values to be accessed with the indices embedded in Afa seed lexicography. These are the numbers embedded in Igbo centric nka na uzu (science and technology). These two are never seen apart: They are the main aspect of the ancient existence. They also enter many aspects of our lives through numbers. Accordingly, there are four (four element comprising of the components of our dimension) market days: These make a week: There are 13 months in Igbo calender making all 364 days in a year. In Igbo culture three heads are better that one, not two heads are better than one. "Ehibe akwukwo nato ite esibe." Here the expression explains that, a three legged cooker will set the foundation for cooking. -This also explains the power (3) which is a half of 16 in base 2. It is imperative that we in the age of quantum computers must try to find the inflection point where the ancient crosses path with the modern. There is a deep alignment with what many consider mystical to number theory, discrete math (truth tables) and application into logic gates as such the use of odd numbers which easily can divide even integers without any remainder. Whatever an even number complements is basically accessed with an odd index number; odd number is accessed by an even one.

The ancient components of the Afa ensemble held by the Di.bia Afa or doctor of Afa:
1. 4 strings with four nodes attached to each string = collection of transistors (central processor unit)
2. Turtle shell                 =                 tower casing for desktops
3. Afa wand                     = input device e.g keyboard/mouse
4. Ugiri seeds or acorn (as it is used in modern time) from white oak = transistors

# Sample Afa Cast

The sample here represents the closed nodes with the filled circles or ovals while the empty circles or ovals represents an open node. There is a way or ways to interpret meaning in the array of casted seeds. We do know that all that had been said, being said and will be said are within the spectrum of what is within the reach of thoughts and being. Afa is the oracle with the meaning deeply rooted into cosmology. -The record of time immemorial is in Afa.

![alt text](https://github.com/jumezurike/AfaPrincipleSixteen/blob/main/Afastring.png "Sample casted string")

What you see is rascally encoded so that a lay man will never understand its dual nature. It will remind you of the truth table or permutation and combination of a chance in all possibilities. This is where machine learning comes in as a harbinger of artificial intelligence (AI). The work already done serves as the lookup table handed down to us by our ancestors: They where the first to study this. We now have all we need for all the possibilities which has non-colloquial high level language understood by those who practise the Afa language.- It is possible to begin the formulation into modern high level languages to enhance our predictions of the future thereby impacting humanity to a large extent. We can understand from the konwledge of arithematic. We know that every set casted has a negative dimension to it. That is the balance of odd and even; positive and negative; yin and yang in nature. 

### Take for example 4 bit-wise representation of the combination from the outcome:

12 -->> 1100 is eqaully -4 in binary
11 -->> 1011 is also -5 in binary

# ML & AI 
Machine learning in AFA (the mechanism of knowing that which is hidden) is the algorithm (all series of instructiond that must be followed to reach a decision): It involves many inputs LWE, supervised and unsupwervised leading all trialed samples to a trusted value. In the end the inputs are reduced with in a reasonable statistical construct of weights favoring the output. What you see below is the process used by a Di.bia or Babalawo (typically known as medicine man) with a knowledge of divination to determine the condition of the sick or patient. If this is how the chatbot of today are designed to work too. The question is. What is the difference there, if not similarity? The chicken and the egg which came first? Science is not the difference in things, rather what makes these things similar. With artificial intelligence embedded (AI) bots really do very interesting things as we see it today. For example: targeted advertising, phone receptionists and online customer service.

![alt text](https://github.com/jumezurike/AfaPrincipleSixteen/blob/main/afa-ifa.png "AI Bot simulation")

The notion of mysticism is only in lack of understanding by the lay man who so ever alludes to it. This wo/man does not understand the dynamics in nature because of the stillness in her/his mind. The changes which permeates all does not phase him/her therefore weakens his/her mind's eye with volatility. S/He will run when it is time to walk. Then walk when it is time to run. One who understands the changes in all things around, is known as the "Omara" not the "Ofeke" or "OSE AKA" (14, 10) in accordance to Afa language interpretation. There is boolean functionality in everything that must become. -To be or not to be.==>>1 or 0. There is something quite interesting between the (1 and 0) and another that falls way outside 1 | 0, 1&0.

This we denote by !(1|0, 1&0). We can now have 1, 0, 1&0 and !(1|0, 1&0) possibilities of a stable standard state that extens modern computing.

# Clarity of purpose

Let's go through the mechanical translation of the SAMPLE CAST shown earlier:

You will concatenate the open sets from right to left. You will have to get the corresponding numbers of each string following binary 4 bit-wise.

- 1 + 4 = ijite (8) aka (10) => iweli aka ikenga elu : To be progressive

- 4 + 2 = aka (10) Obala (6) => ndi chizulu echizu : Titled men

- 3 + 1 = aghali (5) ijite (8) => irado ive dika alo : Showing strong backing for something

- 3 + 4 = aghali (5) aka (10) => ive na agba dika akpi : Something that stings like scorpion or sand ant

- 3 + 2 = aghali (5) obala (6) =>Ndi echichi : Titled people

- 1 + 2 = ijite (8) obala (6) => ukwu isi mmadu ike nala ; To be alright

- 4 + 1 = aka (10) ijite (8) => ana : land

Note the first and the last stanza these are the segue to the deeper meaning of the cast as the middle stanza decides the direction.

The meaning does not always come out of the first cast: However, you can clearly see the direction when you examine the loop carefully. 

The meaning of the casted string: 
                                      " One will become progressive in the land: Wherein, the support of powerful men will suffice. However the so called powerful ones will also become the stinging pain or obstacle."
                                     
The mechanism of the ancient oracle have not seen any make over as to the direct connection to modern science. This means certain practices will have to modify so that individuals will take their thoughts and essence of being to draw it following certain transcendental rules. The thought process (ATUMATU) of the consciousness master plan is of certain components: The vibrations of the mind. It follows in string theory this vibration determines the mass, force, and graviton of the matter. - This currently echoes in quantum mechanics as superposition which is practically the entanglement.

# RULES

1. Closed and open circles or ovals must be used to identify the state: This could mechanical or in a digital form.
2. Seekers must use the provisioned medium to create closed and open circles reflecting their thoughts or problem.
3. When a string is all closed the whole set must be recasted: It only follows a theory where emptiness is only mental.
4. All three different sets of four-string ensemble must be constructued by the seeker to address the predictive accuracy.
5. This will be submitted to the oracle using the proper, unique and unparalleled protocols.

Oracle is simply a blackbox in the level of turing machine which will follow stringent instructions and input to finally present a conclusive output. The oracle will always arrive at a decision or conclusion. "I Ching": Is another divination system that could use this approach of number theory. We are certain that human lives could be enhanced by the decision owed to the wheels of the oracle. The uncertainties in the spectral lines of our existence could be reduced via reasonable, predictive, and resilient software. We are working on getting clearer and precise to excellent predictions. 

" Afa is an ancient African divination tool, cosmological treatise, and codification framework, that is thousands of years old, pre-dating all known computer science or computation.
Within Afa, we find the principles of binary expression (0 to 1), hexadecimal expression (0 to 15), base 20 & base 32 radices, matrix theory (4 by 4 grid), and wave theory (16 nodes with infinite interpretive permutations). " 

#The Goal

We would create an AI (NLP) from special LLM with machine learning: Machines will be trained to learn the algorithms which unravels meaning in Igbo or Youruba or Hausa vocabulary (The alphabets or components of the spokent language). Note a syllabrary could be a better approach check out this extraordinay work https://ndebe.org. This LLM for low resource languages could allow the users to leapfrog that would unleash the ingenuity and enhance creativity. More so, tapping into AFA in our day-to-day lives will inspire us and advance our worldview to economic independence. We will put out the lexicon or dictionay of AFA word permutations in the nearest future. -This will be the beginning of the foundation model (text and textlike characters). The common vocabulary covering the language of interest (Igbo):

A,a B,b CH,ch D,d E,e F,f G,g.

GB,gb GH,gh GW,gw H,h I,i ị,ị J,j.

K,k KP,kp KW,kw L,l M,m N,n Ṅ,ṅ

#AFA and the Renaissance of Linguistic Diversity: How can AFA improve ethnic languages?

Most ethnic language of the Congo-Kwa structure are vowel-cosonant-vowel. e.g Aka or A.ka or another example Akwu or A.kwa - You usually have vowels before the root word and then another vowel after the consonant. 
Majority of these languages stopped growing after the domination of the empires like Brittish empire till today. At the very bloom of the human development these culture were neglected and replaced with the colonial tongues. These languages were abruptly hindered from growing in a natural sense. In nature anything that fails to grow will certainly die. Until we see the connection between these languages and the fundamentals of AFA. It is imperative that we master the ancient wisdom to infuse the visible footprint or components of our being into the modern tools this will defuse the sloppy thoughs of existentiality and machine rivalry. With the understanding of AFA knowing that every word structure within this "Kwa" enthno group of language can define its own meaning by its own name. Let's take a look at this two words separately. We will use vowel-to-root suffix linking or linking vowel-prefix to root. We are going to dabble into two disctinct examples. 
1. Lungs  = Ngugu -> N-gu-gu-> This is the body organ that allows humans to breathe. What does it really mean "gu" the root word means take a hold(hold fast) depending on what comes after it could be in a positive or negative direction. 
2. Soothe = Guguo -> gu-gu-o -> This is a possesive word used in igbo language to show that one is soothing a crying baby. "gu" appears twice. That could only mean to take a firm hold. 
Question: How did they know that the lungs has something to do with crying? This is not an isolated case as you can see it all through the Kwa languages. The point is that once the inflection points of the language, the root meaning, accentuation, and the various phonetics are studied and noted as a part of NLP class of LLM fine tuning. It will be very easy for AI to give meaning to the modern english words by affixing the local words; create new words within the context of the original ancient languages. These are still pure and divine in the context of AFA by so doing we create a balance in the cycle of life and restore a sustainable balance in nature. 

#Conclusion
In the pursuit of technological advancements, the renaissance of linguistic diversity holds the promise of a more inclusive, responsible, and culturally aware future.- Although language is not the only way to communicate realities. The study of Congo-Kwa languages, intertwined with the principles of AFA (Predictive Oracle), offers a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between ancient wisdom and the current realities to build cutting-edge AI technologies that will impact humanity with accessibility to AI: This will leapfrog many dormant ecomomies of the world. As we delve deeper into the linguistic roots, we will unearth a treasure trove of knowledge waiting to be integrated into the ever-evolving realm of LLM (NLP) and AI, ultimately enriching our understanding of language and culture as the physical manifestation of the human operation system (agwu). The issue of existentiality could be carefully analyzed and could be seen to belong to the set of everything in the cosmos. The existence of aliens does not threaten the existence of humans. Does it? As we approach artificial general intelligence mankind will also become powerfully intelligent: Since it is still a handful of mankind and humans that built the AGI or the advanced stage of AI for the good of all.
