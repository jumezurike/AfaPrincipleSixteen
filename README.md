"Computer science mimics Afa Oracle - THE PRINCIPLES OF SIXTEEN.
# The principle of 16 
‘Ikpukpara’ is the principle of 16. Numerals here are measures of count and quantity which start from zero, one, two, four and progresses to the multiple of fours. At the very bloom of human development it was capped at 16. There are 16 seeds or elements in a continuous matrix held in the basis of the 16 principles. The basis is designed for values to be accessed with the indices embedded in Afa seed lexicography. These are the numbers embedded in Igbo nka na uzu (science and technology). Accordingly, there are four market days: These makes one week: There are 13 months in Igbo calender making all 364 days in a year. In Igbo culture three heads are better that one, not two heads are better than one. There is a deep alignment to number theory, discrete math (truth table) and application into logic gates as such the use of odd numbers which easily can divide even integers without any remainder. Whatever an even number complements is basically accessed with an odd number. 

The acncient Components of the Afa ensemble held by the Afa Dr:
1. 4 strings with four nodes attached to each string = processor
2. Turtle shell                 =                  casing for computer
3. Afa wand
4. Ugiri seeds or acorn (as it is used in modern time) from white oak.

# Sample Afa Cast

The sample here represents the closed nodes with the filled circles while the empty circles represents an open node. There is a way or ways to interpret meaning in the array of casted seeds. We do know that all that had been said, being said and will be said are within the spectrum of what is within the reach of thoughts and being. Afa is the oracle with the meaning deeply rooted into cosmology. -The record of time immemorial is in Afa.

What you see is rascally encoded so that a lay man will never understand its dual nature. It will remind you of the truth table or permutation of a chance in all possiblilities. This is where machine learning comes in as a harbinger of artificial intelligence (AI). The work already done serves as the lookup table handed down to us by our ancestors: They where the first to study this. We now have all we need for all the possibilities which has non-colloquial high level language that could be understood by those who speak the Afa language.- It is possible to begin the formulation into modern high level language that will enhance our predictions of the future thereby impacting humanity to a large extent. We can understand from the konwledge of arithematic we understand that every set casted has a negative dimension to it. That is the balance of odd and even; positive and negative; ying and yan in nature.

# ML & AI 
What you see below is the process used by Di.bia or Babalawo (typically known as medicine man) to determine the condition of the seeker or patient.
If this is how the chatbot of today are designed to work too. The question is. What is the difference but similarity? The chicken and the egg which came first? Science is not the difference, rather what makes them similar.  With artificial intelligence embedded (AI) bots really do very interesting things as we see it today. For example: targeted advertising, phone receptionists and online customer service.
