"Computer science mimics Afa Oracle - THE PRINCIPLES OF SIXTEEN.
# The principle of 16 
‘Ikpukpara’ is the principle of 16. Numerals here are measures of count and quantity which start from zero, one, two, four and progresses to the multiple of fours. At the very bloom of human development it was capped at 16.-This is basically two words form bits perspective. There are 16 seeds or elements (nkpuru Afa) in a continuous matrix held in the basis of the 16 principles. The basis is designed for values to be accessed with the indices embedded in Afa seed lexicography. These are the numbers embedded in Igbo centric nka na uzu (science and technology). These two are never seen apart: They are main aspect of the ancient existence. They also enter many aspects of our lives through numbers. Accordingly, there are four (four element comprising of the components of our dimension) market days: These make a week: There are 13 months in Igbo calender making all 364 days in a year. In Igbo culture three heads are better that one, not two heads are better than one. "Ehibe akwukwo nato ite esibe." Here the expression explains that, a three legged cooker will set the foundation for cooking. It is imperative that we in the age of quantum computers must try to find the inflection point where the ancient crosses path with the modern. There is a deep alignment with what many consider mystical to number theory, discrete math (truth tables) and application into logic gates as such the use of odd numbers which easily can divide even integers without any remainder. Whatever an even number complements is basically accessed with an odd index number; odd number is accessed by an even one.

The ancient components of the Afa ensemble held by the Di.bia Afa or doctor of Afa:
1. 4 strings with four nodes attached to each string = collection of transistors (central processor unit)
2. Turtle shell                 =                 tower casing for desktops
3. Afa wand                     = input device e.g keyboard/mouse
4. Ugiri seeds or acorn (as it is used in modern time) from white oak = transistors

# Sample Afa Cast

The sample here represents the closed nodes with the filled circles or ovals while the empty circles or ovals represents an open node. There is a way or ways to interpret meaning in the array of casted seeds. We do know that all that had been said, being said and will be said are within the spectrum of what is within the reach of thoughts and being. Afa is the oracle with the meaning deeply rooted into cosmology. -The record of time immemorial is in Afa.

What you see is rascally encoded so that a lay man will never understand its dual nature. It will remind you of the truth table or permutation and combination of a chance in all possibilities. This is where machine learning comes in as a harbinger of artificial intelligence (AI). The work already done serves as the lookup table handed down to us by our ancestors: They where the first to study this. We now have all we need for all the possibilities which has non-colloquial high level language that could be understood by those who understand and speak the Afa language.- It is possible to begin the formulation into modern high level languages that will enhance our predictions of the future thereby impacting humanity to a large extent. We can understand from the konwledge of arithematic. We know that every set casted has a negative dimension to it. That is the balance of odd and even; positive and negative; yin and yang in nature. 

### Take for example 4 bit-wise representation of the combination from the outcome:

12 -->> 1100 is eqaully -4 in binary
11 -->> 1011 is also -5 in binary

# ML & AI 
What you see below is the process used by a Di.bia or Babalawo (typically known as medicine man) with a knowledge of divination to determine the condition of the seeker or patient. If this is how the chatbot of today are designed to work too. The question is. What is the difference there, if not similarity? The chicken and the egg which came first? Science is not the difference in things, rather what makes these things similar. With artificial intelligence embedded (AI) bots really do very interesting things as we see it today. For example: targeted advertising, phone receptionists and online customer service.

Mysticism here is only in the lack of understanding by the lay man. This man does not understanD the dynamics in nature because of the stillness in his mind. The changes which permeates all does not phase him therefore affects his being. He will run when it is time to walkd. Then walk when it is time to run. One who understands the changes in all things around, is know as the "Omara" not the "Ofeke" or "OSE AKA" (14, 10) in accordance to Afa language interpretation. There is boolean functionality in everything that must become. -To be or not to be.==>>1 or 0. There is something quite interesting between the (1 and 0) and another that falls way outside 1 | 0, 1&0.

This we denote by !(1|0, 1&0). We can not have 1, 0, 1&0 and !(1|0, 1&0).

# Clarity of purpose

Let's go through the mechanical translation of the SAMPLE CAST shown earlier:

You will concatenate the open sets from right to left. You will have to get the corresponding numbers of each string following binary 4 bit-wise.

- 1 + 4 = ijite (8) aka (10) => iweli aka ikenga elu : To be progressive

- 4 + 2 = aka (10) Obala (6) => ndi chizulu echizu : Titled men

- 3 + 1 = aghali (5) ijite (8) => irado ive dika alo : Showing strong backing for something

- 3 + 4 = aghali (5) aka (10) => iver na agba dika akpi : Something that stings like scorpion or sand ant

- 3 + 2 = aghali (5) obala (6) =>Ndi echichi : Titled people

- 1 + 2 = ijite (8) obala (6) => ukwu isi mmadu ike nala ; To be alright

- 4 + 1 = aka (10) ijite (8) => ana : land

Not the first and the last stanza these are the segue to the deeper meaning of the cast as the middle stanza decides the direction.

The meaning does not always come out of the first cast: However, you can clearly see the direction when you examine the loop carefully. 

The meaning of the casted string: 
                                      " One will become progressive in the land: Wherein, the support of powerful men will suffice. However the so called powerful ones will also become the stinging pain or obstacle."
                                     
The mechanism of the modern oracle have not seen any make over. This means certain practices will have to modify so that individuals will take their thoughts and essence of being to draw it following certain transcendental rules. The thought process (ATUMATU) of the consciousness master plan is of certain components: The vibrations of the mind. It follows in string theory this vibration determines the mass, force, and graviton of the matter. - This currently echoes in quantum mechanics as superposition which is practically the entanglement. 

#Framework



# RULES

1. Closed and open circles or ovals must be used to identify the state: This could mechanical or in a digital form.
2. Seekers must use the provisioned medium to create closed and open circles reflecting their thoughts or problem.
3. When a string is all closed the whole set must be recasted: It only follows a theory where emptiness is only mental.
4. All three different sets of four-string ensemble must be constructued by the seeker to address the predictive accuracy.
5. This will be submitted to the oracle using the proper, unique and unparalleled protocols.

Oracle is simply a blackbox in the level of turing machine which will follow stringent instructions and input to finally present a conclusive output. The oracle will always arrive at a decision or conclusion. "I Ching": Is another divination system that could use this approach of number theory. We are certain that human lives could be enhanced by the decision owed to the wheels of the oracle. The uncertainties in the spectral lines of our existence could be reduced via predictive and resilient software. We are working on getting clearer and precise to excellent predictions. 

" Afa is an ancient African divination tool, cosmological treatise, and codification framework, that is thousands of years old, pre-dating all known computer science.

Within Afa, we find the principles of binary expression (0 to 1), hexadecimal expression (0 to 15), base 20 & base 32 radices, matrix theory (4 by 4 grid), and wave theory (16 nodes with infinite interpretive permutations). "
