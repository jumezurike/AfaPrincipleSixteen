"Computer science mimics Afa Oracle - THE PRINCIPLES OF SIXTEEN.
# 1.The principle of 16 
‘Ikpukpara’ is the principle of 16. Numerals here are measures of count and quantity which start from zero, one, two, four and progresses to the multiple of fours. There are 16 seeds in a continuous element held in the basis of the 16 principles. The basis is designed to index the values embedded in Afa seed lexicography. This is the numbers embedded in Igbo nka na uzu (science and technology). Accordingly, there are four market days: These makes one week: There are 13 months in Igbo land making all 364 days in a year. In Igbo culture three heads are better that one, not two heads are better than one. There is a deep understanding of the number theory as such the use of odd numbers.
Components of the Afa system:
1. 4 strings with four nodes attached to each string
2. Turtle shell                 =                  casing for computer
3. Afa wand
4. Ugiri seeds or in modern time acorn from white oak are used in the strings

# ML & AI 
The above is the process used by Di.bia or Babalawo (typically known as medicine man) to determine the condition of the seeker or patient.
If this is how the chatbot of today are designed to work too. The question is. What is the difference but similarity? The chicken and the egg which came first? Science is not the difference, rather what makes them similar.  With artificial intelligence embedded (AI) bots really do very interesting things as we see it today. For example: targeted advertising, phone receptionists and online customer service.
